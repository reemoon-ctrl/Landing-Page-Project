# Landing Page Project

This project builds a multi-section landing page with  ## smooth scrolling ##, dynamic navigation, and an active state for sections in the viewport.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The landing page is designed to be responsive and provides a user-friendly navigation experience. Key features include:

* **Dynamic Navigation:**  The navigation menu is generated dynamically based on the sections within the page, ensuring easy maintainability as content is added or removed.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls the user to the corresponding section.
* **Active State:**  The current section in the viewportn is visually highlighted with an "active" state.
* **Scroll-to-Top Button:**  A button appears when the user scrolls down the page, allowing quick navigation back to the top.
* **Responsive Design:** The page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on various devices.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Navigate through the sections using the dynamic navigation menu or by scrolling.

## Dependencies

This project has no external library dependencies other than Font Awesome, but including Font Awesome is considered a best practice in modern front-end web development.
